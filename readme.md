# Enhanced Job Info Copier (JIC) for LinkedIn

### Streamline Your LinkedIn Job Search with Advanced JIC: Now with Job Description, Location, and Job Type

The Enhanced Job Info Copier (JIC) is a browser extension built upon the original JIC's powerful framework, designed specifically for job seekers who use LinkedIn. This fork introduces crucial new features to the already robust tool, making it even easier to organize and track your job applications.

**What's New?**
- **Job Description**: Capture detailed descriptions directly from job postings to get a clearer understanding of each role.
- **Location & Job Type**: With added fields for Location and Job Type, organize your job search by preference and suitability, all in one place.

**Why Upgrade to Enhanced JIC?** The job search process on LinkedIn can be overwhelming. With Enhanced JIC, not only can you quickly copy job details like company name, position link, and salary range, but now, with the inclusion of Job Description, Location, and Job Type, your job search becomes more refined. This additional context helps in making informed decisions and tailoring your applications more effectively.

**Getting Started Is Simple:**
1. **Integration with Google Sheets**: Utilize the updated [Google Sheets Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1olQSS2sapEdOYd3oSRpjNoczluL94islhz9affI2zfY/edit?usp=sharing) specifically designed to accommodate the new fields. This template is your dashboard for tracking the entire application process.
2. **Effortless Data Capture**: Navigate to a job listing on LinkedIn, use the shortcut "Ctrl+E" or "Command+E," and instantly copy all the critical information, including the new fields, into your clipboard.
3. **Organize Your Search**: Paste this information into the Google Sheet to systematically track every application, from initial application to final outcome.

**Enhancements for Salary Listings**: Whether the job lists an annual salary or an hourly rate, Enhanced JIC effortlessly captures and calculates the compensation, including a formula for annualizing hourly wages based on a 2,080-hour work year, minus 30 days for well-deserved rest.
